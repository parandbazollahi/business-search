# Getting Started with Create Business Search using the Yelp Fusion API.

On the first page, you can search for businesses in Naperville.
When you select a search, it will take you to a second page where you can see details about the business.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start ` in Terminal

It will Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any line errors in the console. For example(Access to XMLHttpRequest has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.)

### `Fix CORS policy in Chrome`

The CORS issue should be fixed in the backend. Temporary workaround uses this option.

Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application

Open command prompt

Execute the command: chrome.exe --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="c:/ChromeDevSession"

Using the above option, you can able to open new chrome without security. this chrome will not throw any cors issue.
